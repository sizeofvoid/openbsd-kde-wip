A Qt 5 module that adds support for getting events from gamepad devices
on multiple platforms.

This module provides classes that can:
 - read input events from game controllers (Button and Axis events),
   both from C++ and Qt Quick (QML);
 - provide a queryable input state (by processing events);
 - provide key bindings.

This package contains sources for QtGamepad usage examples.
