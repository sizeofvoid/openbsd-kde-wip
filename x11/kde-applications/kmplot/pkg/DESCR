KmPlot is a mathematical function plotter for the KDE.

It has built in a powerfull parser. You can plot different functions
simultaneously and combine their function terms to build new
functions. KmPlot supports functions with parameters and functions
in polar coordinates. Several grid modes are possible. Plots may
