Lokalize is the localization tool for KDE software and other free and open
source software. It is also a general computer-aided translation system (CAT)
with which you can translate OpenDocument files (*.odt). Translate-Toolkit is
used internally to extract text for translation from .odt to .xliff files and
to merge translation back into .odt file.
