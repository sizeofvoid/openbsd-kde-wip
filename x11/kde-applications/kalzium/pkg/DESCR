program that visualizes the Periodic Table of Elements (PSE) and includes basic
information about all common elements in the PSE. It has a gained much more
functions over time.

Features:

 - versatile overview of all important data from the elements like melting
   points, electron affinity, electronegativity, electron configuration, radii,
   mass, ionisation energy
 - tool to visualize the spectral lines of each element
 - different colored views of the PSE: separation of the different blocks, Year
   simulator, Temperature simulator
 - Molecular weight calculator
 - an Isotope table
 - 3D molecule editor, with a load and save functionality
 - an equation solver for stoichiometric problems
 - filetype conversion for different types of chemical programs
 - tool to produce a comprehensive list of all Risk_and_Safety_Statements
