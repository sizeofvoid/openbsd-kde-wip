KWalletManager is an optional tool which can greatly assist your work-flow
while maintaining security.

 - Wallets are encrypted against your chosen passphrase
 - Wallets are, by default, closed. Your passphrase is required to open a
   wallet
 - Wallets can be configured to close when unused
 - You control which applications may use the wallet - everything else will
   have to ask you for a password.
