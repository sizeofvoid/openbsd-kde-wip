Lieutenant Skat (from German Offiziersskat) is a fun and engaging card
game for two players, where the second player is either a live opponent
or the built-in artificial intelligence.

The game is played using a single deck of cards. Cards are shuffled and
distributed amongst the players in such a way that half of them are face
down and half of them are face up. Each player plays one of their face
up cards per turn. As soon as all the cards are played the round ends
and points are calculated and awarded.
