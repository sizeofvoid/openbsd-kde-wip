Kajongg is the ancient Chinese board game for 4 players. Kajongg can be
used in two different ways: Scoring a manual game where you play as
always and use Kajongg for the computation of scores and
for bookkeeping. Or you can use Kajongg to play against any combination
of other human players or computer players.

If you are looking for Mah Jongg solitaire, use the kmahjongg package.
