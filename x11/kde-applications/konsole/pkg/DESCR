Konsole is an X terminal emulator for the KDE platform, allowing
users to have a convenient way to use the command line. Aside from
providing a way to use a powerful shell, Konsole also offers features
that make it easier or more pleasurable to work in the command line,
such as profile management, scrollback, and color schemes, including
translucency for effects.

Konsole also provides an embedded KPart terminal which is used by
apps such as Yakuake, Dolphin, and Kate, giving users a consistent
and familiar interface when working in the command line.
